       <h2>Studies üìñ</h2>
           <p>
            One year to graduate from Kedge Business School with an MSc in International Trade specialized in Logistics and Supply Chain Management, I have also acquired a bachelor‚Äôs degree in international Trade and Logistics. I am able to use this theoretical knowledge and put it into practice according to the specificities of the companies and situations.

        <h2>Professional Experiences ü§µ‚Äç</h2>
            <p> 
            I made the quick decision to gain professional experience in addition to my educational. That's why, during the last year of my bachelor, in the curriculum of my professional contract, I‚Äôve worked as a Supply Chain assistant in a global company which sells office furniture. 
            My first two years of study also allowed me to carry out several internships both in French and English-speaking countries where I held growing roles and responsibilities. 
            Finally, between the bachelor and my Master of Science, I took the opportunity to work abroad at different positions. These complementary experiences allowed me to acquire both hard and soft skills.
